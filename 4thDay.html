            <h2>Cappadocia</h2>
            <details>
                <summary>
                    Cappadocia is one of the most magical regions in central Turkey.

                    It is famous for its unique rock formations and fairy chimneys.
                </summary>
                <p>These formations were created by ancient volcanic eruptions.

                    Over time, wind and rain shaped the soft tufa rocks into tall cones.

                    People later carved homes, churches, and tunnels into these rocks.

                    This created an underground world unlike anywhere else on Earth.

                    Cappadocia has been inhabited since ancient times.

                    The Hittites, Persians, Romans, and Byzantines all left their mark here.

                    Early Christians found refuge in its caves and underground cities.

                    They built hidden churches decorated with colorful frescoes.

                    These ancient frescoes still tell stories from the Bible.</p>
